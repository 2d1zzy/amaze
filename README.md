# amaze


## What and Why?

This is a simple project where I work through the book "Learning Web Application Development" _By: Semmy Purewal_


I will keep updating this README as I keep building.

---

### Chapter 1
This was an introduction to IDE's and Version Control and Git, along with basic Terminal commands.



### Chapter 2 
This chapter introduce me to the basics of HTML tags and div elements. Built a basic Web page with a link to a FAQ page. 
Then pushed it all to the Github repository. 

The next Chapter dives in to CSS, however I am not sure if it will continue with the code that has already been written. 
Hope so. Should be fun building it out piece by piece.



### Chapter 3 
This chapter has been an introduction to CSS. The majority was easy to follow along to.
The end of the chapter culminating in styling the "Amazeriffic" Web Application.


### Chapter 4
Here I added JavaScript and jquery, added functionality. I also used modern syntax such as `const` and `let`, with the help of Chatgpt.
