## What and Why?

This is a simple project where I work through the book "Learning Web Application Development" _By: Semmy Purewal_


I will keep updating this README as I keep building.

### Chapter 2 
This chapter introduce me to the basics of HTML tags and div elements. Built a basic Web page with a link to a FAQ page. 
Then pushed it all to the Github repository. 

The next Chapter dives in to CSS, however I am not sure if it will continue with the code that has already been written. 
Hope so. Should be fun building it out piece by piece.
